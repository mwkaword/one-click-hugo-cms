    text: In 2020, partly because of a spate of terrible night’s sleep mixed with
      being mostly stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I challenged
      myself to produce a piece of writing each day. The challenge I set myself
      was to do this for one hundred days straight. This book is a collection of
      all of these pieces of writing, which cover the themes of technology,
      fantasy, friendship, family and much more.

    text: "Amanda Blake reaches for her phone. She’s still half-asleep, but the
      call’s from her old school and holds the promise of the one thing she
      desperately needs: blood. To get what she wants, she’s told she can help
      look into a killing that’s created another unwanted member of her own
      kind. One more vampire, who, just as Amanda was not so long ago, will be
      instructed on how to live an unwanted second life at the school of the
      undead."

    text: Not long after a strange mist descends in her town, Florence, the daughter
      of the local watchmaker, has to leave. It was not just the townsfolk
      around her who had changed their ways and who wanted her to change her
      own, it was something else that really drove her away; there was something
      in the mist. She was not sure if this something was connected to the
      distant sorcerer who was said to spread the mist, but she was certain that
      she was afraid.

  text: On my blog, I'm attempting to post a new piece of writing each week. Who
    knows if I can keep it up. I created the page in 2020 for my challenge to
    post one hundred pieces of writing in one hundred days.
